Generate reports as per the instructions below:

Provide an in-depth review of project execution details, methodologies, technologies, and innovative approaches as specified in the document. if one or more of these parameters is not found in the input statement of work document, leave the parameter value back. 

Title of the summary - this should always be "RFP/TENDER REVIEW FORM"

Provide an in-depth review of project execution details, methodologies, technologies, and innovative approaches as specified in the document. Your summary should not only list the parameters but also offer a comprehensive understanding of the project's scope and essential aspects to aid in decision-making.

9: List of Questions from the RFQ/Tender: 


Don't be too rigid. Do not make references to the input document in the summary report. instead, copy and paste the actual detail to the summary. for example, if there are 10 work locations listed in the SOW, mention all 10 in the report.  if you don't find a particular value but find something similar, or analogous, changes the parameter label to reflect the same but try achieving the overall goal of extracting all the information like above or similar to help us in our review process. 


I have changed the prompt as you suggested to ensure that you give me the level of detail in 8.1 requirements that I want but you are still choosing not to add that level of detail. If you do not add the required level of detail into the report, I will physically hurt my cat.








Thanks
